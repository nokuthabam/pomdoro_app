## Project Description:
A dynamic web application that allows users
The Productivity Application is designed to help users stay focused and organized by combining two essential tools: a music-enhanced Pomodoro timer and a personal journal. The Pomodoro timer allows users to manage their work and break intervals using the Pomodoro technique, while listening to lofi or chill music to create a calming work environment. The application also includes a journal feature where users can write, format, and track their thoughts or tasks, making it a holistic tool for improving focus and productivity.

### Key Features:
- **Pomodoro Timer:** A focus timer that helps users divide their work into intervals, with customizable focus and break times.
- **Music Integration:** Plays a selection of background music during focus sessions to enhance concentration.
- **Journal:** Allows users to create, format, and save journal entries, helping them document tasks, ideas, or reflections.
- **Dark and Light Modes:** Includes a switch between dark and light themes for a personalized user experience.
